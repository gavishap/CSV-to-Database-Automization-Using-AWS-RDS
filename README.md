# CSV-to-Database-Automization-Using-AWS-RDS
Developed a script to take a given CSV link from a website, download to your machine and convert the the dataset into a database stored in the AWS RDS infrastructure. In addition I ran SQL queries to the converted CSV and stored the output in a separate CSV which I uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket.
